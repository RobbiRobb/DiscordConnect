## Overview
DiscordConnect is a MediaWiki extension that aids in identifying users on a Discord server of a wiki. Users can add their global Discord username in their preferences, which can then be read via the API. In combination with a Discord bot, this then allows for one- or bidirectional matching and identification of Discord and wiki users. This extension alone is not capable of doing this; it only provides the necessary interface to authenticate wiki users.
